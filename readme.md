# Haiku-Collector

PHP app using MySQL build as an exercise to learn the LAMP stack.
It has a reporting and voting systems for the users to decide which Haikus are inappropriate and should be removed or restored.


## Future Development and Improvement Ideas

- make it more scalable by loading only enough Haikus to fill the screen then load the rest of the haikus on scroll
- try and use Angular for the front-end
